Through experimentation in multiple genres of writing, students gain confidence by utilizing new tools of communication and diversifying their modes of written expression. They will develop complex arguments around the form and content of poems, essays, novels, and long-form literary journalism, often in conversation with established critical voices. The work of the year culminates in a major, article-length piece of nonfiction known as the LJP, or Literary Journalism Project, which asks students to undertake original research and investigation into a pressing local issue. Our readings come from the broad spectrum of American literature, from the period of colonization of the Americas to the present, and help us give multiple answers to the questions of what it means to be, or become, an American. There are no conclusive answers to this question; rather, we hope the course opens out to continued inquiry.\"\n",

Other topics of study will supplement a student’s understanding of the Four Noble Truths; these include emptiness, dependent arising, compassion, cyclic existence, and karma.
